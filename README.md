# Theming

This sample project uses ngrx to handle color changes in CSS variables. Some minor SCSS scripts are being used to do a little theming.
Color variables are saved as a pseudo rgb format, i.e. red, green, blue without declaring it as a color.
You can change any color in the pickers and they get immediately reflected to the site.
They are not persisted and reset upon reload.
